# PayrollApplication

This project will be a Payroll System to allow someone to view, edit and add employees to a database. A user will have a few different views. One view where a user can click on an employeeId and display the resulting employee. Also a second view where a user can edit an employees information. Thirdly a view where a user can input a new employees information and add that to a database. Lastly, a view where a user can view a table with all the employees information.

# Data that will be used

I will be using a couple different attributes for an employee. An employee will be defined as someone with an employeeId, name, manager, department, payrate and ssn.
